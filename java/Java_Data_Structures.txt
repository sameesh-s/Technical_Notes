Types of Data Structures
========================
A data structure is a way of collecting and organizing data.
Choosing the right data structure impacts efficiency.
Data comes from many sources(e.g., databases and files).
Many data structures are implemented as linked lists.

ArrayList - Stores objects and can grow and shrink
LinkedList - uses pointers to keep track of elements.
Vector - can grow and shring; provides synchronization.
Stack - operates on last in, first out(LIFO).
Queue - operates on first in, first out(FIFO).

Collections framework
Iterable interface
